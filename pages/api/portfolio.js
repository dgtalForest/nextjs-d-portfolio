      "Luxico is a high-end vacation rental platform that I had the opportunity to work on. The backend of the website was developed using Node.js, a powerful JavaScript runtime built on Chrome’s V8 JavaScript engine. This provided the website with efficient performance and scalability. For the frontend, I utilized a combination of JavaScript frameworks including React.js and Next.js. React.js allowed for the creation of interactive UIs, while Next.js facilitated server-side rendering for improved performance and SEO. The UI framework Marko was also used for its simple syntax and efficient updates. The web server was powered by Next.js, providing a lightweight and efficient solution. For video content, I incorporated Vimeo, a popular video-sharing platform. To ensure the security of the website, I implemented reCAPTCHA for spam protection and HSTS for secure connections. For real-time interactions, I integrated Salesforce Service Cloud for live chat support, enhancing customer engagement.",
